This is code developed by BBN to support the
2016 TAC KBP Event Argument and Linking Shared Task.
A description of this task will be released soon.

This repository contains three artifacts:
* `tac-kbp-eal` contains classes to represent system responses and assessments for
the task. While these are mainly to support the executables in this repository,
if your system is based on Java or another JVM language, you are strongly encouraged
to use them.  Note that they can be used from Python via Jython.
* `tac-kbp-eal-scorer` contains the scoring code.
* `bin` contains all the non-java executables
